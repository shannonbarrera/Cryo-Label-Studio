## 📂 Presets & Templates

The app comes with built-in presets and label sheet templates, including formats for **Cryo Babies**, **Cryo Tags**, and **Tough Spots** labels.

You can create your own presets in the app to generate the exact labels you need.  
If you want to use the app with other types of labels, you can also add new templates by editing the source code and rebuilding the app yourself. Developers are welcome to fork this repository, add additional templates, and customize the app for their own workflows.

## 🧩 Adding a New Template

Cryo Label Studio comes with built-in templates for Cryo Babies, Cryo Tags, and Tough Spots labels.  
You can add your own templates to use with other label types.

**Steps to add a new template:**

1. **Create a blank template in Word**  
   - Set up the page layout, table grid, and margins so they match your label sheet.
   - Save the file as a `.docx` in the `templates/` folder of the source code.  
     Example: `templates/MYNEW-1000.docx`

2. **Edit `label_templates.py`**  
   - Open `label_templates.py` in a text editor.
   - Add a new entry to the `label_templates` dictionary with the following fields:
     ```python
     "MYNEW-1000": {
         "display_name": "My New Label 1.00 x 0.50",
         "template_path": "templates/MYNEW-1000.docx",
         "label_width": 1.00,
         "labels_across": 5,
         "labels_down": 20,
         "chars_per_line": 30,
         "lines_per_label": 5,
         "default_font_size": 8,
         "table_format": "checkerboard",  # or "LSL stripes"
         "needs_page_break": False,
     },
     ```
     Adjust the values for your label’s dimensions and layout.

3. **Rebuild the app**  
   - If running from source:  
     ```
     python gui.py
     ```
   - If creating a standalone EXE: rebuild with PyInstaller:
     ```
     pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm gui.spec

     ```

Once rebuilt, your new template will appear in the template dropdown inside the app.
